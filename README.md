## What is Parallax?

The term “parallax” first came from the visual effect of 2D side scrolling videogames that used different background image movement speeds to create the illusion of depth during gameplay. This was generally done by making the background of the game move slower than the foreground in order to make it seem further away. You can see this same effect as you're driving on the road. You'll notice that the trees and houses that are closer move much faster than the mountains in the distance. This same concept applies to parallax site design in which the background of the website moves at a different speed as the rest of the page for an impressive visual effect that allows for countless creative applications for online storytelling.

## How can I get started using parallax in my code?

We can create these effects in many different ways. The main way you'll see on the web is known as the 'Layer Method'. As the name implies, we are creating different layers that scroll as different speeds.

### Parallax with CSS

Arguably one of the simplest ways of creating a parallax effect, CSS3 enables us to add the `background-attachment: fixed;` attribute, which can be used to create a nice scrolling effect. The `CSSParallax` component we have made just includes our image containers, and some separators with text inside. It's a very easy effect to git, and it gives a very nice look to the whole thing.

Unfortunately, videos don't work very well with this type of parallax. There are ways to do it in javascript, but not with vanilla CSS.

### Super awesome side scrolling effect and rotation and other cool things

There are a lot of other great parallax effects you can create on the web. Below are some projects that have been made by other DevMountain mentors! I'd highly recommend checking them out, because they're great!
